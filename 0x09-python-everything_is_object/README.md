The tasks in the "Python - Everything is object" repository primarily explore object-related concepts in Python. They cover various aspects, including object identity, memory address, comparisons, assignments, immutability, and object creation. Each task is represented by a set of questions or code snippets, aiming to deepen the understanding of Python's object behavior and memory management. These tasks provide insight into the fundamental principles governing object-oriented programming in Python.
