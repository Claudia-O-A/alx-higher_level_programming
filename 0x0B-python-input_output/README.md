This repository focuses on Python's Input/Output handling, diving into the implementation of core functions like `with`, `open`, and `read`, alongside the `json` module. It offers insights into file manipulation, serialization, and deserialization of objects using JSON in Python. The included tasks cover file reading, writing, appending, JSON operations, object serialization, Pascal's Triangle generation, log parsing, and even a script to modify a running process's heap. Each task file serves as a practical exercise illustrating various aspects of file handling and JSON operations in Python.
